/**
 * Js array works as inBuilt stack
 * Binary heap => parent always greater than child = max Heap
 * Heapify => delete a value and place the last element of array at it's place; 
          => and make the array again to heap; this process is known as heapify
 * Heap sort => instead of deleting swapping the first with last and go on. until the
                array sorts;  
 * Find loop in list => send 2 pointers with different speed, they will meet at some timeðŸ˜‰
 * Types of tree => full (2 or null), 
                    complete (All the leaf elements must lean towards the left), 
                    perfect(complete && 2) && balanced; 
 * Avl => searching is faster (strictly height balanced).
 * red-black => insertion and deletion is faster 
 *
